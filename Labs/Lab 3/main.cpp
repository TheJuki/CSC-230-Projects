//Open Sequential file for reading using ifstream
//Open Binary file for binary|writing using fstream
//Set position to 1
//Read in a line from the sequential file
//while(not sequential.eof())

//Convert line into binary file object
//Seek position and write record in binary file
//Pass Primary Key information to Primary Index(title, position)
//Pass Secondary Key information to Secondary Index(artist or year, position)
//position++
//Read in another line from Sequential file

//Update Binary File record zero with count information
//Write Primary Index to a file (open file using ofstream)
//Write Secondary Index to a file (open file using ofstream)
//Close all files
