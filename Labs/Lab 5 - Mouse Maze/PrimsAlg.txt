(MST)Min_spanning_tree = start_node;
    while min_spanning_tree != all nodes
        Add Ni to MST with Edge E;
        if Ej connects Ni (not in MST)
            to Nk (in MST) and it is the shortest edge

Kruskal's Alg

start:
    Every node in its own set
    PQ has all edges by edge weight
    Form joined sets by edges

A tree is a acyclic data structure with a unique Node playing the role of the root.
Nodes are "connected" via pointers (if not array based)

A threaded binary search tree has cycles (lots of them)!

A binary search tree (bst) is a binary tree that satisfies the ordering property
that says all nodes in a given tree, left subtree have values less than the root value
(of that subtree) and those in the right subtree have values >= the root value (of that subtree)
