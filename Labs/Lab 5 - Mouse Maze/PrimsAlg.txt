Prim's Alg
(MST)Min_spanning_tree = start_node;
    while min_spanning_tree != all nodes
        Add Ni to MST with Edge E;
        if Ej connects Ni (not in MST)
            to Nk (in MST) and it is the shortest edge

Kruskal's Alg

start:
    Every node in its own set
    PQ has all edges by edge weight
    Form joined sets by edges
